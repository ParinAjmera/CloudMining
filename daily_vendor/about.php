Welcome to Daily Vendor. We are happy to help you with your basic need , as you can find them with ease using out site , we hope you enjoy.
The classifications shown in the figure depend on the current state of available
technologies, and thus will change as new tools emerge for implementing electronic commerce.
For example, low-denomination transactions are not well suited to electronic
commerce because no standard method for transferring small amounts of money on the
Web has become generally accepted (although such standards are taking shape;
Chapter 11 contains a more detailed discussion of this issue). If a company or group of
companies could develop a standard that gains general acceptance among buyers and
sellers, low-denomination transactions could move from the traditional commerce column
to the electronic commerce column.
